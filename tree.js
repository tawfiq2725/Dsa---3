// Tree Data Structure Overview
// A tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes, where each node can have zero or more child nodes. The topmost node is called the root, and nodes without children are called leaves.

// Key Terms
// Parent: A node that has one or more child nodes.
// Child: A node that descends from another node (parent).
// Root: The topmost node in the tree.
// Leaf: A node that does not have any children.
// Sibling: Nodes that share the same parent.
// Ancestor: A node that is higher up in the tree and connected via parent-child relationships.
// Descendent: A node that is lower in the tree and connected via parent-child relationships.
// Path: A sequence of nodes and edges connecting a node with another node.
// Distance: The number of edges in the path from one node to another.
// Degree: The number of children a node has.
// Depth: The length of the path from the root to the node.
// Height: The length of the path from the node to the deepest leaf.
// Edge: The connection between two nodes.
// Subtree: A tree consisting of a node and its descendants.
